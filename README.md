Custom Home Assistant Dashboard Card voor Sigenstor


### This Repo is in Development

## Singenstor

I have a new installed Sigenergy Sigenstor Inverter, Battery, Gateway and AC-EV-loader. I think the mySigen app has one of the better graphics used for the energy paths used at that very moment, and I had the idea to make the infographic from the house with the components available as a lovelace card for HA. 


## Prerequsites

This card fully depends on the HACS integration https://github.com/TypQxQ/Sigenergy-Local-Modbus
